# smart-photobooth
The project aims at introducing innovation to the existing idea of photobooths. Like the generic photobooths, it’ll have a dedicated set-up to click good quality pictures, but by technical intervention we will make it better equipped to today’s world. It is likely to gain popularity in instances of social functions where people are interested in making memories and do not want to indulge with professional photographers.  Users will be able to activate the camera using an RFID, and billing and other facilities can be availed in a similar fashion. The real motivation for the project came from the dilemma every student face during a college festival or a similar event where finding the right spot to click a picture is a troublesome task. This can be solved by bringing back the old tradition of photobooths with a smarter implementation, so people can get a good quality picture with good lighting and decent background.  The technology involved is extremely interesting and working with raspberry pi made us realize the far and wide scope of innovation it can provide us with. The project as simple is enough to engage a lot of public and make their social excursions a lot more fun and memorable.
